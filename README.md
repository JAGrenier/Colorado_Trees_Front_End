# Colorado Trees Front End

## Description
When I first moved to Colorado from the east coast, I was unfamiliar with the trees. I was working an outdoor guide and quickly had to get up to speed so I could share information with my clients about the beautiful trees found in Colorado. Reflecting on this experience inspired me to make this project for others who would like to learn more about trees in Colorado.

Colorado Tree is a full-stack web app that displays trees of Colorado. Users can view trees, login, favorite trees, then the next time they login in to see which trees they favorited. There is also a FAQ page directing users to further resources about the trees of Colorado.
